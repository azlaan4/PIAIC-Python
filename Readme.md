# Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to learn **Python** and get some *hands-on experience*  on this trending technology in the wolrd of programming. For learning purposes i am using some internet resources and following this easy, short and precise book, Title [A Smarter Way To Learn Python](http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/python/index-of-exercises.html) by [Mark Myers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-myers-a889a53) Author of the **"A Smarter Way to Learn"** *series* of computer programming books.
