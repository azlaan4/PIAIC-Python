# In Python, as in algebra, the ambiguity is cleared up by precedence rules.
#  the rules that applies here is like BODMAS
#  if an expression contains brackets ((), {}, []) we have to first solve or simplify
#  the bracket followed by of (powers and roots etc.), then division, multiplication,
#  addition and subtraction from left to right.
