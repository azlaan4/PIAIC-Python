# There are three rules about naming a variable:
#   1. You can't enclose it in quotation marks.
#   2. You can't have any spaces in it.
#   3. It can't be a number or begin with a number.

# In addition, a variable can't be any of Python's reserved words, also known as
# keywordsâ€”the special words that act as programming instructions, like print.
