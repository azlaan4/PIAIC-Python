# Now we come to a couple of operators that may be new to you
# List of Unfamiliar Mathematical Operaters

#   1. Modulus (%)
#   2. Increment Short-hand (age+=1 or age*+1)
#   3. Decrement Short-hand (age+=1)

# Incrementing Age by 5
age += 5

# Decrementing Age by 5
age -= 5

# Incrementing Age by 5 times
age *= 5
